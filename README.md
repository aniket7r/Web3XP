# Web3XP

Web3XP enables Web3 products to engage more developers. With weekly prizes and short, interactive, and fun tutorials and walk-throughs that showcase the power and possibilities of these products. Developers can quickly learn and apply different Web3 products to build killer dApps while standing a chance to get win cash prizes & cool NFTs.

The Web3XP project is designed to reinvent the way we learn about web3 products, protocols, and decentralized applications (dApps) through interactive tutorials, engaging walk-throughs, and comprehensive introductions. Web3XP seeks to empower individuals, regardless of their technical background, to navigate the rapidly evolving web3 ecosystem with ease and confidence.

Users will have to complete specific tasks that are verified real-time to ensure users get a real-world feel of how certain protocols or dApps work.

Quests (learning modules) focus on a particular topic and compose a series of tasks, Q and A’s, opinion polls and more. On completion of certain quests users get a very cool Limited Edition NFT on completion.

Moving forward more mini-game exercises will be added to make the whole experience of learning new protocols exciting and engaging.
